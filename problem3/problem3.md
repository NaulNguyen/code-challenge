# Computational Inefficiencies and Anti-Patterns

## 1. Issues and Improvements

### a. Redundant `getPriority` Calls within `useMemo`:

**Issue**: Inside the `useMemo` hook for `sortedBalances`, the `getPriority` function is called multiple times for the same `balance.blockchain`. Specifically, it's called once in the `filter` callback (`balancePriority`) and then twice more in the `sort` callback (`leftPriority` and `rightPriority`) for each comparison. This leads to redundant computations, especially for large `balances` arrays.

**Improvement**: Calculate and store the priority once for each `WalletBalance` object. This can be done by mapping over the `balances` array first to augment each balance with its priority.

### b. Incorrect Filtering Logic in `useMemo`:

**Issue**: The `filter` condition `if (lhsPriority > -99)` uses `lhsPriority` which is undefined in that scope. It should likely be `balancePriority`. Also, `if (balance.amount <= 0) { return true; }` followed by `return false` means only balances with `amount <= 0` are kept if their priority is `>-99`. This seems counter-intuitive for displaying positive balances. It's more likely the intention was to filter out balances with `amount <= 0` or those with a priority of `-99`.

**Improvement**: Clarify the filtering logic. If the intention is to filter out items with getPriority returning -99 OR amount <= 0, then the logic should reflect that explicitly. For example, return balancePriority > -99 && balance.amount > 0;.

### c. Dependency Array for `useMemo` (`[balances, prices]`):

**Issue**: The `prices` dependency is included in the `useMemo` for `sortedBalances`. However, `prices` are not used within the `sortedBalances` calculation. This means that if `prices` change, `sortedBalances` will be re-calculated unnecessarily.

**Improvement**: Remove `prices` from the `useMemo` dependency array for `sortedBalances`.

### d. Sequential map Operations and Redundant Formatting:

**Issue**: There are two separate `map` operations: one to create `formattedBalances` and another to create `rows`. The `formatted` string is generated in `formattedBalances` but then `sortedBalances` is mapped again to create `rows`. This is inefficient. Additionally, `balance.amount.toFixed()` is called in `formattedBalances` and then `balance.formatted` is passed to `WalletRow`. If `toFixed()` is only for display, it should ideally be done closer to the rendering or within the `WalletRow` component itself, especially if `balance.amount` is needed as a number elsewhere.

**Improvement**: Combine the mapping and formatting into a single pass. The `usdValue` calculation also depends on `prices`, so that part should be done together with formatting.

### e. key={index} Anti-pattern:

**Issue**: Using `index` as a `key` in `map` is an anti-pattern when the list items can be reordered, added, or removed. React uses keys to efficiently re-render lists, and an `index` can lead to incorrect component state or rendering issues if the order of items changes.

**Improvement**: Use a unique and stable identifier from the `balance` object (e.g., `balance.currency` if it's guaranteed to be unique within the list, or a unique `id` if available) as the `key`.

### f. `WalletBalance` Interface Missing `blockchain`:

**Issue**: The `WalletBalance` interface defines `currency` and `amount`, but the `getPriority` function and the filtering/sorting logic rely on `balance.blockchain`. This indicates a missing property in the interface, which can lead to type errors or runtime issues.

**Improvement**: Add `blockchain: string;` to the `WalletBalance` interface.

### g. `BoxProps` Not Defined:

**Issue**: The `Props` interface extends `BoxProps`, but `BoxProps` is not defined in the provided code block. This would result in a TypeScript error.

**Improvement**: Define `BoxProps` or remove the extension if it's not relevant. For the refactored code, I will assume it's a simple `div` and not strictly necessary to extend external props unless they are passed down and used.

### h. `lhsPriority` Undefined Variable:

**Issue**: As noted in point 2, `lhsPriority` is used in the filter callback without being defined. This will cause a runtime error.

**Improvement**: Correct the variable name to `balancePriority`.
